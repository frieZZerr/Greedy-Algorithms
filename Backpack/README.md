### What's the problem?
It's so simple even ***wikipedia.org*** can explain it.

> "The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include
> in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible."
